As a result, jobs created for e-commerce have grown 334% since 2002[1]. E-commerce has become the preferred way for many more people to shop. Particularly after COVID,  when many stores were closed or people wished to avoid going out among other shoppers,  the convenience of delivery to the home became necessary. \n"

However, the top return product refunds were over one million pounds sterling, and the second largest refund was over 0.75 million pounds sterling. Usually, a top return product was purchased by a lot of different customers. However, the top return product, Paper Craft Little Birdie, was purchased only once in 13 months. We can check the product’s quality, webpage demonstration and sale process to find out what needs to be improved. \n",
