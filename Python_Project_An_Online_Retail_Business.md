<h2><span style="color:blue">Introduction: Growth of E-commerce</span></h2>  


E-commerce has kept growing and became a new channel to support businesses development. It has helped large retailers expand their customer base by selling online and given small businesses a chance to sell directly to customers on their own sites or through a platform like Amazon’s.  As a result, jobs created for e-commerce have grown 334% since 2002[1]. E-commerce has become the preferred way for many more people to shop. Particularly after COVID,  when many stores were closed or people wished to avoid going out among other shoppers,  the convenience of delivery to the home became necessary.

<h2><span style="color:blue">Data Analysis</span></h2>

#### Analysis:  Overview

#### Discussion 1:

#### Analysis:  Monthly Sales 

!["sales"](https://github.com/ZiqiPolimeros/Python-Project-Online-Retail-Business/blob/main/pictures/1_sales.png?raw=true)

#### Discussion 2: 
- According to the monthly sales graph, over 90% of sales revenue was from Europe.
- The sales revenue increased from December 2018 to August 2019 and grew rapidly after September. The revenue from November was more than double the amount of the lowest sales month (2019/2).
- We removed the data of December 2019 because there were only ten days records in the month.


<br>

#### Analysis:  Customers

!["sales"](https://github.com/ZiqiPolimeros/Python-Project-Online-Retail-Business/blob/main/pictures/5_customer.png?raw=true)

#### Discussion 3:

- There were 102 customers who only purchased once, and the one-time customers rate was 2.15%.


<br>

#### Discussion 5:
- We made a correlation heatmap of the top 60 selling products. It shows that the absolute value of correlation coefficient of the great majority of the 60 products were smaller than 0.5. From the graph, we can say that very few products were accessories. They were mostly stand-alone products.
- The two pairs of products that have correlation:<br>
 "Asstd Design 3d Paper Stickers" and "Mini Paint Set Vintage" is  0.604839<br>
 "Small Chinese Style Scissor"  and " Lunch Bag Vintage Doily" is 0.545964 <br>
They both have a moderate relationship with each other.[3]

<br>

<h2><span style="color:blue">Suggestions </span></h2>

- The one-time purchase customer rate was 2.15% which means that the repeat customer rate was 97.85%. A repeat customer rate that is viewed as successful is between 20% to 40%[4]. We suggest that the company can invest more in marketing to expand the customer base.
- The product return rate of the year was 5.06%,  which is considered a low return rate as compared to the average return rate 10.6%[5]. However, the top return product refunds were over one million pounds sterling, and the second largest refund was over 0.75 million pounds sterling. Usually, a top return product was purchased by a lot of different customers. However, the top return product, Paper Craft Little Birdie, was purchased only once in 13 months. We can check the product’s quality, webpage demonstration and sale process to find out what needs to be improved. 
- Based on the heatmap graph, we can tell that most of the popular products were not related to each other. We suggest that the company offer some sales promotions or recommendations for product pairings (Customers who bought this also bought that) to increase the quantities of product sales.
